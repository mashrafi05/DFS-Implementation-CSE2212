# DFS-Implementation-CSE2212
Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) implementation using an adjacency matrix, a visited list, and recursion in C++ for CSE 2221.
The time complexity of Breadth-First Search (BFS) is O(V + E), where V represents the number of vertices (nodes) and E represents the number of edges in the graph. This is because, during a BFS traversal, each node is visited exactly once. When a node is first encountered, it is added to a queue and marked as visited to prevent reprocessing. This results in at most V operations for handling the nodes. Additionally, for each node, we examine its adjacent nodes by scanning through its edges. Each edge in the graph is checked at most twice—once from each of its endpoints in the case of an undirected graph—which means that edge processing overall takes O(E) time. Therefore, the total time complexity becomes O(V + E). The reason BFS is not O(V × E) is because it does not repeatedly process all edges for each node. That kind of complexity would only arise in algorithms that perform nested iterations over nodes and edges, such as some brute-force or network flow algorithms. Since BFS touches each vertex and edge only once, it remains efficient and linear relative to the size of the graph.
